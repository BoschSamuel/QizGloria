We are building a tight integration of Qiskit capabilities with PyTorch. One may seamlessly use tools from both frameworks with integrated functionality. We have included some basic tutorials to illustrate the framework. 

Our "Hello World!" notebook involves training parameters for a 1-qubit rotation, in order to attain a target expectation value. The specified cost function is the mean squared error and the chosen torch optimiser is Adam.
